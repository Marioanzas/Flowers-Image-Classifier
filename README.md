# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

Sample command line for launching the `train.py` script:
```
python train.py flowers cat_to_name.json -GPU
```

Likewise, a sample command line for launching the `predict.py` script:
```
python predict.py flowers checpoint-resnet50.pth cat_to_name.json -GPU
```
